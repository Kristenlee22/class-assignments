## Loading my first data file

Load in the csv file I created

```{r cats}
cats <- read.csv(file = "data/feline-data.csv")
cats
str(cats)
cats$weight  #grabbing weight column by first putting $
cats$weight + 2
typeof(cats$likes_string)
cats$coat # weird becaue its words, but type shows integer-- r by default reads character data as factors 
as.character(cats$coat)-> dd #adds quotes

```
